# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

## Data Analysis

The analysis was conducted using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.  
The Titanic dataset consists of 891 rows of training data and 418 rows of test data, with features such as:

- Pclass  
- Name  
- Sex  
- Age  
- SibSp  
- Parch  
- Ticket  
- Fare  
- Cabin  
- Embarked  

### Key Insights

- **Gender**  
  The most significant factor. Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to male passengers. Visualizations show a clear dominance of survival among females.

- **Pclass (Ticket Class)**  
  First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to third-class passengers. This is likely due to better facilities and easier access to lifeboats.

- **Age**  
  The age distribution showed that children (<10 years) had a higher survival rate compared to adults.

- **Fare**  
  Higher ticket fares were positively correlated with survival, since they are linked to better cabin classes.

- **Family Size**  
  Passengers traveling alone were more vulnerable, while those with small family sizes (2â€“4 members) had better chances of survival.

- **Embarked**  
  Most passengers boarded at Southampton (S). There were differences in survival rates among embarkation points, but not as strong as gender and ticket class.


## Modeling

The baseline model used **Logistic Regression** from `scikit-learn`.

- The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% validation.  
- Logistic Regression was trained with `max_iter=200`.  
- Validation accuracy achieved: **~81%**.  

This baseline model is simple yet competitive, and provides a strong foundation for future improvements with feature engineering and advanced models.


## Next Steps

- Perform feature engineering (e.g., `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, `Title` extracted from `Name`)  
- Try different models such as RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning (`GridSearchCV`, `RandomizedSearchCV`)  
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for serving predictions via API
