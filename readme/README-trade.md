## Introduction  
In June 2025, the stock market told an exciting story. Prices rose and fell, trading volumes spiked, and companies revealed their financial strengths and weaknesses. This project captures those movements, turning raw data into insights that help us understand how the market behaved and what it means for investors.

## What We Looked At  
We explored real stock market data that included: company values, earnings, dividends, and daily price movements. The goal wasn’t just to crunch numbers but to discover **patterns and relationships**—what drives people to buy and sell, and how companies of different sizes behave.

## Key Market Insights  

### 1. When Did the Market Get Busy?  
Early June looked normal, but by **mid-June** (around June 9th), there were sudden spikes in trading activity. Many stocks saw large jumps in the number of shares traded, though this didn’t always lead to price increases. It showed us that **volume alone doesn’t dictate price**—market mood and sentiment matter more.

### 2. What Do the Numbers Say About Companies?  
- **PE Ratios**: Most companies sat in a healthy range, suggesting stable valuations. A few, with very high numbers, hinted at growth expectations—or possible overpricing.  
- **Dividend Yields**: Some companies rewarded investors steadily, while many others offered no dividends at all, preferring to reinvest in growth.  
- **Market Cap & Earnings**: Larger companies generally earned more per share, proving the advantage of scale.  

Together, these findings highlight that **size matters for stability and earnings**, but it doesn’t always guarantee higher returns through dividends.

### 3. Weathering the Market  
Comparisons showed that not all financial indicators move together. For instance, how much a company is “worth” in the market (valuation) doesn’t necessarily mean it pays out more to investors. This disconnect reveals different strategies—some companies reward shareholders directly, others build long-term value.

## Predictions: Looking Ahead  
We also built tools to see if stock prices could be predicted based on what we know. The results were striking: our models were able to **predict stock closing prices with remarkable accuracy**.  

For clients and investors, this means that with the right data, it’s possible to anticipate market moves and **make more confident investment decisions**.

## Conclusion  
The story of June 2025’s stock market can be summed up in a few key lessons:  

1. **Trading activity doesn’t always mean price changes**—investor sentiment is just as powerful.  
2. **Big companies often earn more per share**, but don’t always share it as dividends.  
3. **Stock prices can be predicted with high accuracy**, offering a valuable edge for those who act on data-driven insights.  

In short, this project transforms complex stock data into a clear narrative. It helps investors see beyond numbers and recognize the patterns that shape real market behavior.
