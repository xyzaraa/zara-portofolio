## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel reservation data to explore the key factors influencing hotel management success, as well as consumer trends and behaviors.  

The goals of this project are:  
- Provide insights for more informed decision-making regarding bookings and marketing strategies.  
- Help hotel managers adjust pricing and strategies for high and low seasons.

## Data Modelling
Models compared for predicting cancellations:  
- **CatBoost** ‚Äì Best performance (highest accuracy)  
- XGBoost  
- KNN  

![Model Comparison](https://github.com/xyzaraa/hotel_analysis/blob/main/Assets/Model%20Comparison.png?raw=true)  

CatBoost outperformed the others, showing stronger ability to capture complex patterns for reliable predictions.
