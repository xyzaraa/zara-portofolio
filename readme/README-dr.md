This study shows that the fine-tuned ResNet50 model is capable of
classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Although the ResNet50 model has demonstrated good performance without preprocessing techniques, the implementation of CLAHE and Gaussian blur combination techniques can improve image quality and the model's ability to identify features in retinal images. These results indicate that the image quality provided by 
pre-processing techniques greatly influences the success of the ResNet50 model 
in detecting diabetic retinopathy.
